# Git Commands to Push Your Changes

Run these commands to push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (if not already there)
cd "C:\Users\Armando Barlick\Documents\prototype1"

# Stage all your changes
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add deployment files, mortgage calculations, and cost of living updates"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin lovable-rebuild
```

If you want to deploy from the `main` branch instead, you can:

```bash
# Switch to main branch (or create it)
git checkout -b main
# OR if main exists: git checkout main

# Merge your changes
git merge lovable-rebuild

# Push to main
git push origin main
```
